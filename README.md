# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "Toy App"

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). "Toy App"

Topics Covered in Chapter 2:
- High-level overview of Rails
- Introduction to MVC
- Introduction to REST architecture
- Beginning data modeling
- Deploying a live, database-backed web application in production

Lessons Learned:
- Scaffolding automatically creates code to model data and interact with it 
  through the web (good for getting started quickly)
- Rails uses the Model-View_Controller pattern for structuring web applications
- The REST architecture includes a standard set of URLs and controller actions
  for interacting with data models
- Rails supports data validations to place constraints on the values of data
  model attributes
- Rails comes with built-in functions for defining associations between
  different data models
- We can interact with Rails applications at the command line using the Rails
  console

Note:
The tutorial uses BitBucket in order to introduce the basic usage of Git through
private repositories. I have decided to stray from that and use GitHub for my
learning.
